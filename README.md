## Description: 

A Color Gradient Tool that allows generating gradients 
with different amount of intermediate steps from certain "seed" tiles: 
A (left, first), B (right, last) and C (center, only when 3-color mode is active). 

Supports 2- and 3-color mode.

The gradients can be generated using different color spaces (sRGB, LAB etc) 
and can be represented using different color modes (Hex, RGB etc.). 

Finally, we have relatively flexible color format conversion functionality, 
useful when many color values need to be converted between Hex, RGB 0-1 or RGB 256.

And a tip of the hat to Copilot and its cousins—couldn’t have done it without you.
